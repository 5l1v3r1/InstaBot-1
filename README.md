# instabot
This is an Instagram bot that likes a users picture in order to gain more followers (real users).

You can obviously do this manually by hand, scrolling tiresly throught Instagram or...

This program scrolls through a certain hashtag, e.g(#linux, #programming, etc) and likes `n` pictures.
It's main purpose is to gain followers without being banned or using fake accounts.
As of 2018-09-04, the current likes per hour rate limit for Instagram varies on accounts, so adjust accordingly.
You can fork, copy this program as you like as long as you credit the author (https://github.com/n30-14)
Constructive criticism welcomed... Enjoy! :)
